## Setting up Buildroot <a name="buildroot"></a>

In order to generate the Linux and boot stage binaries compatible with Wally, Buildroot is used for cross-compilation.

To set up a Buildroot directory, configuration files for Buildroot, Linux, and Busybox must be copied into the correct locations inside the main Buildroot directory. Buildroot and device tree binaries must be generated as well.

This can all be done automatically using the Makefile inside Wally's Linux subdirectory (this one). The main Wally installation script (`bin/wally-tool-chain-install.sh`) runs this by default, so buildroot is likely already setup. Otherwise, to install a new buildroot directory, build the Buildroot binaries, generate the device tree binaries, and generate testvectors for simulation run:

```bash
$ make
```

This installs to the `$RISCV` directory. Buildroot itself is installed to `$RISCV/buildroot` and the test-vectors are installed to `$RISCV/linux-testvectors`.

Optionally, you can override the `BUILDROOT` variable to install a different buildroot source directory.

```bash
$ make install BUILDROOT=<path/to/buildroot>
```

## Generating Device Tree Binaries <a name="devicetree"></a>

The device tree files for the various FPGAs Wally supports, as well as QEMU's device tree for the virt machine, are located in the `./devicetree` subdirectory. These device tree files are necessary for the boot process.

They are built automatically using the main `make` command. To build the device tree binaries (.dtb) from the device tree sources (.dts) separately, we can build all of them at once using:

```bash
$ make generate # optionally override BUILDROOT
```

The .dts files will end up in the `<BUILDROOT>/output/images` folder of your chosen buildroot directory.

## Disassembling the Binaries for Debugging <a name="disassembly"></a>

By using the `riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump` utility, we can disassemble the binaries in `<BUILDROOT>/output/images` so that we can explore the resulting machine code instructions and see what assembly or C code the instructions came from, along with the corresponding addresses. This is useful during debugging in order to trace how code is being executed.

The disassembled binaries are built automatically using the main `make` command. To create the disassembled binaries separately, run:

```bash
$ make disassemble # optionally override BUILDROOT
```

You'll find the resulting disassembled files in `<BUILDROOT>/output/images/disassembly`.

## Generate Memory Files for Linux Boot <a name="testvectors"></a>

Running a linux boot simulation uses a preloaded bootrom and ram memory. We use QEMU to generate these preloaded memory files. The files are output to `$RISCV/linux-testvectors`. The memory files are generated automatically when using the main `make` command. Alternatively, they can be generated by running

```bash
$ make dumptvs
```

## Creating a Bootable SD Card <a name="sdcard"></a>

To flash a bootable sd card for Wally's bootloader, use the `flash-sd.sh` script located in `<WALLY>/linux/sdcard`. The script allows you to specify which buildroot directory you would like to use and to specify the device tree. By default it is set up for the default location of buildroot in `$RISCV` and uses the vcu108 device tree. To use the script with your own buildroot directory and device tree, type:

```bash
$ cd sdcard
$ ./flash-sd.sh -b <path/to/buildroot> -d <device tree name> <DEVICE>
```

for example
```bash
$ ./flash-sd.sh -b ~/repos/buildroot -d wally-vcu118.dtb /dev/sdb
```
