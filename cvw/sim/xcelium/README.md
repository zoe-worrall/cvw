## Xcelium Simulation with CVW

NOTE: Xcelium is not regularly tested and may not work correctly. It is also not integrated with the `wsim` command used for CVW, so the config and testsuite must be manually modified in `wally.xrun` and it does not support all of the other options provided by `wsim `.
